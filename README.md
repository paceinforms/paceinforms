## About

INFORMS aims to facilitate interest and exploration in the fields of operations research, management science, and analytics. Business analytics is a skill, and once mastered, can be utilized to enter any industry. Employers today look for those who can leverage data to gain insights and make business decisions. 

 

Whether you are already in the program, want to explore what analytics is like, or want to learn in-demand skills that give your resume an edge - INFORMS is for anyone interested in business analytics!

 

Throughout the year, we hold a variety of events:

 

- Workshops: We host beginner-friendly workshops covering popular analytics programs, such as Excel, Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and more. 

 

- Career Development: From Coffee Chats with guest speakers, Alumni Panels, Industry Exposures to company Road Trips, we work with Career Services to provide opportunities for individuals to learn and network to showcase their business analytic skills to employers. 

 

- Community: We want members to strengthen their networks by connecting with each other. We host group bonding events and hackathons to give members a chance to interact with one another.
